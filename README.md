# A1000_RAM_Expansion_II
Modern Amiga 1000 Front Ram Expansion

This project is an effort to offer a modern appraoch to the Amiga 1000 front Ram Expansion.

The included PCB is untested as of now and will probably eithor not work or be subject to change after initial testing.
Thanks to Joachim Firnhaber for his help and good words (there's a lot of... potential), I would probably not have published the files without his okay.

I suggest Users wait until propper testing was done, before ordering boards.

Logic holds current **untested** code. Just like the PCB Design this is currently no more than a starting point or boilerplate. If you're adventurous and it works, leave me a message!!

The Board has Testpoints for RAM Glue-Logic so hopefully issues can be sorted out fast.
HTML BOM is included and should help sourcing parts. RAM should probably go with CY62128ELL Which is available in TSOP-32 Footprint at Reichelt at an extremely low price point. All Parts excluding the 60-Pin Connector are probably less than 20,-- EUR.
