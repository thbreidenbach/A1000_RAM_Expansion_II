# A1000_RAM_Expansion_II
Modern Amiga 1000 Front Ram Expansion

This project is an effort to offer a modern appraoch to the Amiga 1000 front Ram Expansion.

The included PCB is untested as of now and will probably eithor not work or be subject to change after initial testing.
Thanks to Joachim Firnhaber for his help and good words (there's a lot of... potential), I would probably not have published the files without his okay.

I suggest Users wait until propper testing was done, before ordering boards.

Logic holds current **untested** code. Just like the PCB Design this is currently no more than a starting point or boilerplate.

See License before ordering or going forward with this Design.
