# a1000_frontram.ucf
# Example pin constraints for XC9572XL-10VQG64 (VQ64 package).
#
# Adjust LOCs to your PCB routing. This file is primarily a starting point.
#
# Notes:
# - Keep JTAG pins dedicated: TDI=P28, TMS=P29, TCK=P30, TDO=P53 (per DS057).
# - Power / ground / globals (per DS057):
#   VCCINT: P3, P37
#   VCCIO : P26, P55
#   GND   : P14, P21, P41, P54
#   GCK1/2/3: P15/P16/P17 (usable as I/O but recommended for clocks)
#   GTS1: P5, GTS2: P2, GSR: P64
#
# I/O Standard is implicit for XC9500XL; outputs are 3.3V/2.5V CMOS and inputs are 5V tolerant.
